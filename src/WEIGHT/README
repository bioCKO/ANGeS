WEIGHT_weight_linear_interpolation.py: takes a set of ACS and weights each of them using a linear  interpolation(Fitch) algorithm based
on their occurrence in extant species. If the markers are doubled, adjacencies between two extremities of a same initial marker receive
a large weight ensuring they will always be chosed by the branch-and-boun or heuristic C1P scripts.

weight.py: implementation of the algorithm used in the script above.
