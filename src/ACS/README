# Scripts to handle unique markers
acs_unique.py: file containing common intervals and adjacencies computation functions
               common intervals are computed as described in SIAM J. Discrete Mathematics,22:1022-1039. 2008.
               if a pair of genomes has unequal marker content, the markers are first filtered to 
               keep only the one common to both genomes, prior to computing adjacencies and common intervals
               both linear and circular genomes can be considered
	       the concept of reliable adjacency is described in J. Comput. Biol. 17:1097-1112. 2010. 

ACS_compute_supported_adjacencies_unique.py: computes supported adjacencies between two species
ACS_compute_reliable_adjacencies_unique.py:  computes reliable adjacencies betwen three species
ACS_compute_common_intervals_unique.py:      computes common intervals to two species

# Scripts to handle unique markers
acs_nonunique.py: file containing common intervals and adjacencies computation functions
               common intervals are computed as described in CPM 2004, LNCS 3109:347â€“358, 2004
	       markers are NOT filtered to keep common markers
               both linear and circular genomes can be considered

ACS_compute_supported_adjacencies_nonunique.py: computes supported adjacencies between two species
ACS_compute_common_intervals_nonunique.py:      computes common intervals to two species
